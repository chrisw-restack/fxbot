# Live/Demo Audit

## Active Demo Suite Snapshot - 2026-06-03

Source: `live_config.py` `create_live_strategy_specs()` on 2026-06-03.

Current configured suite:

- `EmaFibRetracement` on `config.SYMBOLS`: EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF.
- `EmaFibRunning` on `config.SYMBOLS`: EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF.
- `Engulfing` / `ThreeLineStrikeStrategy` on EURUSD and AUDUSD.
- `IMS_H4_M15` on USDJPY, XAUUSD, EURAUD, CADJPY, USDCAD, AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPCAD, GBPUSD.
- `IMSRev_H4_M15` on GBPNZD, AUDUSD, US30, USDCHF, XAUUSD, AUDJPY, AUDCAD, USDCAD.
- `Failed2_H4_H1_M5_market` on USTEC.
- `CandleConfirmation_USDJPY_H1_M5` on USDJPY.
- `CandleConfirmation_GBPUSD_H1_M5` on GBPUSD.

`live_risk_pct_overrides()` currently returns `{}`, so all live/demo strategies use the global `config.RISK_PCT` setting unless changed later.

Use `live_config.py` as the executable source of truth; update this audit when live/demo membership, symbols, risk, or promotion status changes.

## MT5 Time Normalization - 2026-05-25

Evidence from `logs/trade_journal.csv` and `logs/ReportHistory-52775013.html`
showed that MT5 chart/order timestamps were IC Markets server time, while
`journal_time_utc` was true UTC. In May 2026 the observed offset was +3 hours.

Decision:

- Keep project strategy logic and journals on UTC.
- Convert MT5 bar timestamps from IC Markets server time to UTC in
  `data/mt5_data.py` before strategies see them.
- Write future MT5 history exports to `data/historical/mt5_icmarkets_utc/`.
- Keep the existing `data/historical/mt5_icmarkets/` snapshot as broker-time
  audit evidence; do not merge new UTC-normalized files into it.

Impact:

- Live session filters now run on intended UTC hours instead of broker-server
  hours.
- Future `signal_time_utc` values should be actual UTC.
- Existing journal rows before this change have broker/server candle timestamps
  in `signal_time_utc`, despite the column name.
